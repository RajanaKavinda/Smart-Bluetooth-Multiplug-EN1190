# Smart-Bluetooth-Multiplug-EN1190

This project represents my inaugural foray into the realm of electronics, undertaken during the second semester as part of the Electronic Design Realization module. Our creation, the Smart Bluetooth Multiplug, empowers individuals by enabling them to effortlessly control electrical devices. This product interfaces with a mobile application, providing users with convenient control over their connected devices.

At the heart of the circuit lies an ATmega328p microcontroller, complemented by a meticulously designed PCB housing an array of essential components. This assembly features a crystal oscillator, capacitors, resistors, and a 3-way relay module, all crucial in facilitating seamless device management.

The physical housing of the Smart Bluetooth Multiplug boasts three sockets, each equipped with an AC wire for easy integration into a household power supply. Furthermore, the PCB incorporates an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to supply power to the microcontroller, ensuring efficient operation.

The mobile application interface is user-friendly, with intuitive indicators and controls that streamline the user experience. Within the multiplug, three distinct LEDs serve as unique identifiers, allowing users to easily distinguish and operate connected devices individually.

The product's enclosure was meticulously crafted using SolidWorks software, while the PCB design was executed using Altium software. This comprehensive approach to design and realization underscores the professionalism and attention to detail that went into the development of our Smart Bluetooth Multiplug.
